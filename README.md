# rustymicrobial
Just a personal collection of bundled Rust tools to carry out microbial bioinformatics work.

To compile the program, make sure you have rust installed so you have 'cargo' in your path.
Then do the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/patrickmunk/rustymicrobial

cd rustymicrobial

cargo build --release

target/release/rustymicrobial --help
```
